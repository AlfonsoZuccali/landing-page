# Landing-page

In this proyect I'll be going through the lessons I learned in The Odin Proyect and I'll be making my first web with a possible use.

## Structure of the web

The web will be divided in 4 main parts without incluiding the header and footer. For the location of the divs I'll be using the Flexbox Model.

## Aesthetic of the web

I may not use the exact model that has been given by TOP, I would like to personalize it. I'll definitely use it as guide as what I could do!
